A game about a frog wizard fighting bugs. 
Part 1 can be found here: 
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/897260065/

Instructions:
Use arrow keys to move and asdf to cast spells. 
You can wield up to 4 spells per level.
Spells will only work if you've unlocked them and 
you have enough magic to cast them. Your magic will
regenerate over time, but your health won't.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This is a demo version. Due to time constraints, I cannot
execute my entire plan for the game before the assignment 
due date. The demo consists of one completely playable
level. Only one spell, bubbles, is available, and can be used
by pressing either a or space. Movement controls are the same
as described above.
